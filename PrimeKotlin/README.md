# Kotlin solution by MARKMENTAL


This is an implementation in Kotlin. It is based on 
PratimGhosh86's Java implementation.
It compiles fully to the JVM so all you need to do is either run the .jar file or use the Kotlin CMD to make your own .jar

#Build the Kotlin to a ".jar"
`kotlinc PrimeSieveKotlin.kt -include-runtime -d PrimeSieveKotlin.jar`

#Run the resulting ".jar"
`java -jar PrimeSieveKotlin.jar`

The Dockerfile is also an option for running in a container.
